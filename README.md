**Muslim HipHop** is a website dedicated to showcasing Muslim artists in various music genres, including Hip-Hop, Nasheed, and Pop. The site provides a central location for fans of Muslim artists to explore artist profiles, view album artwork, and listen to music via external links. It serves as a way to support Muslim artists by connecting fans to their work.
